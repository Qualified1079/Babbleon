Branch (push target): `claude/magical-turing-mele8c` (operator
intends to rename to `v1-maintenance` out-of-band; until that
lands, push here)

Date: 2026-06-19 (user-asleep session — claude-opus-4-7)

Last commit before this handoff: `1d0fa1d` — chore(v2-core): clear
12 pedantic clippy warnings

This session landed phase 2 step-1: `v2-babbleon-launch-untrusted`
crate skeleton + the eight lifecycle modules, 21 unit tests green,
compiles clean.  Details under "Phase 2 — current state" below.

---

## TL;DR for the next session

**v1 is deprecated.**  v2 is being built ground-up at `crates/v2-*`.
Phase 0 (design docs) is complete.  Phase 1 (core crate) is ~50%
through; mapping primitives are working with 41 tests green.

**Where to start reading, in order:**

1. `V2_PLAN.md` — vision + 6-phase plan
2. `docs/v2/phase0-decisions.md` — five operator decisions
   (all confirmed; see below)
3. `docs/v2/structure-scrambling.md` — the technical heart of v2
4. `docs/v2/obfuscation-landscape.md` — 7 additional layers + research
5. `docs/v2/phase0-research-notes.md` — 11 research threads
6. `crates/v2-babbleon-core/src/lib.rs` — what's built so far

**Skip:** `crates/babbleon*` (v1, deprecated — do not waste effort
keeping it green).

---

## Five operator decisions, all confirmed

| # | Decision | Confirmed value |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Branch vs subtree for v2 source | **Subtree at `crates/v2-*`** |
| 2 | File extension for scrambled source | **Keep `.py`** |
| 3 | Preprocessor topology | **Standalone binary** |
| 4 | v1 hardening branch | **Rename to `v1-maintenance`** (out-of-band) |
| 5 | TEE direction | **v2.0 = dev laptops + small biz; TEE in v3** |

Also confirmed:

- **Shipping:** GitHub releases with checksums + website mirror +
  downstream sec-vendor packaging.
- **`v1` is deprecated; do NOT gate v2 work on v1 compiling/passing.**
  v1 can break; we don't care.

---

## Three operator design ideas added in the last session (2026-06-15 evening)

The operator brought up three substantial design points after
phase 0 closed.  I answered each in chat but didn't get to file
them as docs.  **These need to be folded into `docs/v2/` early in
the next session.**

### A. Dictionary-order word-tags for code-order layer (layer 4)

**Operator's proposal:** instead of numeric tags marking execution
order, use a per-epoch shuffled wordlist as the order index.
Each code block carries a word-tag drawn from the shuffled list;
execution order = order of tags in the shuffle.

**My assessment:** strictly better than numeric tags.  Word-tags
blend into the scramble (look like every other compound); numeric
tags would be recognizable as ordering metadata even when
scrambled.

**Performance:** O(1) per-block lookup via hash map (word →
position); O(N log N) sort per file; sub-millisecond for typical
files (<1000 blocks).  No performance concern.

**Recommendation:** make word-tags the canonical layer-4
mechanism; ship as default in v2.0; no numeric-tag mode (would be
strictly worse and a maintenance burden).

**TODO:** update `docs/v2/structure-scrambling.md` layer-4 section
to make this the canonical mechanism.

### B. Dynamic / language-agnostic keyword extraction

**Operator's question:** can the scrambler be agnostic to Python,
Go, C, etc.?

**Answer: yes.**  Three substrates, recommended one:

- **Primary: Tree-sitter grammars at preprocessor-build time.**
  ~100 languages supported, MIT-licensed.  `build.rs` script
  consumes each grammar and emits per-language keyword constants.
  Top 6 vendored (Python, Go, C, TypeScript, Rust, sh/bash).
- **Runtime fallback:** runtime-loadable grammar interface for the
  long tail; operator drops a `.so` in `/etc/babbleon/grammars/`.
- **Rejected:** LSP introspection (needs a live server) and per-
  language stdlib metadata (works but not unified).

**TODO:** draft `docs/v2/dynamic-keywords.md`.

### C. GUI-toggleable everything (minimal-terminal philosophy)

**Operator's philosophy:** same plain-English principle as the
audit-readability rename pass should extend to operator surface.
No terminal required for typical use.

**My proposal for v2.1 (after v2.0 CLI ships):**

- Native desktop apps per platform (SwiftUI macOS / GTK4 or Qt6
  Linux).
- All operations toggleable in the GUI, password-protected via
  vault unlock.
- Toggles for: master on/off, per-layer enable/disable, rotation
  rate slider, response policy dropdown, vault backend, tracked-
  tool set, wordlist language selection, audit log viewer.
- Plain-English labels + tooltips ("Rotating every second
  defeats more adversaries but costs more CPU").
- Power-user mode: "Show CLI equivalent" button.

**TODO:** draft `docs/v2/gui-design.md`; file v2.1 as a phase in
`V2_PLAN.md`.

### D. (One existing item, still open) Algorithmic per-role pool sizing

20k for direction markers was back-of-envelope.  Analysis in chat
suggested 5-10k is sufficient and the security comes from
compound size C, not pool size.  **My recommendation:** leave 20k
as v2.0 default (gives slack); tune in v2.1.  Not blocking.

```

---

## What's tested and working in `v2-babbleon-core`

41 unit tests + 1 doc test, all green.

`PerHostSecret`:
- Fixed-length 32 bytes, distinct per-generate
- `from_bytes` accepts only correct length
- No Clone/Copy/Debug (intentional)

`key_derivation::derive_subkey`:
- Deterministic for same inputs
- Different purpose → different output
- Different epoch → different output
- Different secret → different output
- Variable-length output up to 8 160 bytes
- Excessive length returns `Error::Crypto`

`Permutation`:
- Bijective (no collisions for N=100)
- Roundtrip `apply` ↔ `reverse` for N=1000
- Deterministic for same inputs
- Epoch change moves >95% of entries
- Purpose change moves >95% of entries
- Out-of-range inputs return None
- Zero-size construction rejected

`Wordlist`:
- English baseline loads (~370k entries)
- All baseline entries lowercase ASCII
- `from_static_entries` rejects empty / empty-entry / duplicate
- Get/len work as expected

`EpochMapping` / `MappingBuilder`:
- No collisions between tracked tools
- Roundtrip scramble/reveal
- Rotation changes every scrambled name
- Honey count matches `HONEY_COUNT = 50`
- Honey names disjoint from real scrambled
- Different secrets produce different mappings
- `is_honey` (constant-time) recognizes honey + rejects real
- Deterministic for same inputs
- Compound consists of concatenated wordlist entries
- Empty tracked list yields empty mapping (+ honey)
- Single-entry wordlist works (compound is `entry * COMPOUND_N`)

`crypto_compare`:
- Equal bytes / different bytes / different lengths
- Equal hex (case-insensitive) / different hex / invalid hex

---

## v2 phase-1 remaining (the next session's queue)

In order:

1. **Wrapper template port** under v2 conventions.  v1's
   `enforcement/wrapper.rs` shell template ports forward with:
   - HKDF-derived padding (not raw SHA-256 of secret + name)
   - Stale-list + honey-list branches retained
   - Source tag now ships in the FIFO JSON
   - PPID + ppid_start retained for the response-policy PID-reuse
     check
   - All v1 wrapper tests port forward as differential cases
     against the new template

2. **Tripwire types + responder.**  Rename pass during port:
   - `ResponsePolicy` → `TripwireResponsePolicy`
   - `HoneyResponder` → `TripwireResponder`
   - `HoneyTriggered` event → `Tripwire` event with `source` enum

3. **Event bus + sinks.**  Stderr + JSONL + audit-chain sinks
   carry over.  Add `Ed25519Signed` sink as a wrapper around the
   chain.

4. **CLI skeleton** (`crates/v2-babbleon/`) — init / unlock /
   rotate / status / mount-scrambled-view (formerly `apply-ns`).
   v2 names per `docs/v2/naming-conventions.md`.

After phase 1 mapping primitive lands, phase 2 (launcher with file
caps, NOT setuid) follows, then phase 3 (structural scrambling).

---

## Phase 2 — current state (landed this session)

`crates/v2-babbleon-launch-untrusted/` now exists with the 11-step
lifecycle from `docs/v2/least-privilege.md` compartmentalized one
module per step.  The crate is in the workspace, builds clean,
21 unit tests pass.  12 clippy pedantic warnings remain (doc
backticks + `similar_names` on `real_uid`/`real_gid`); they are
warnings (not deny) per security-baseline rule 2.

### What landed

```
crates/v2-babbleon-launch-untrusted/
  Cargo.toml                           ✅
  src/
    lib.rs                             ✅ module map + 11-step doc table

    syscall.rs                         ✅ unsafe quarantine (all libc::prctl,
                                          capget); SAFETY: on every block
    bounding_set.rs                    ✅ step 2 + 10; WORKING_CAPS = the 4
    process_hardening.rs               ✅ step 3 (apply_secret_hygiene)
                                          + step 7 (set_no_new_privs)
    namespaces.rs                      ✅ step 4 (unshare NEWNS|NEWPID)
                                          + step 5 (MS_PRIVATE|MS_REC)
    mounts.rs                          ⚠️ step 6 PARTIAL — only the
                                          tmpfs is mounted; per-tool
                                          bind-mount loop deferred until
                                          daemon-IPC channel exists
    identity_drop.rs                   ✅ step 9 (setgroups + setgid + setuid)
    seccomp_profile.rs                 ✅ step 8 (allowlist; KillProcess
                                          mismatch); 4 self-tests assert
                                          no dangerous syscall slipped in
```

Build:  `cargo build -p v2-babbleon-launch-untrusted` → clean.
Tests:  `cargo test -p v2-babbleon-launch-untrusted` → 21/21.

### Design notes that matter

- **Step 8 (seccomp) runs after step 10 in the orchestrator** even
  though the lifecycle table in least-privilege.md lists it as
  step 8.  Reason: the seccomp allowlist deliberately does NOT
  include `setuid`, `setgid`, `setgroups`, or `prctl` — those are
  privileged surface we want gone before the filter goes on.
  So the orchestrator runs the strict ordering 1..=7 → 9 → 10 → 8
  → 11.  The comment in `main.rs::run` documents the divergence;
  `docs/v2/least-privilege.md` should be updated to match.
- **WORKING_CAPS = 4**: `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `CAP_SETUID`, `CAP_SETGID`,
  `CAP_IPC_LOCK`.  Encoded as raw integers (6, 7, 14, 21) because
  the libc crate does not export them.  Constants are named in
  `bounding_set.rs`.
- **Exit-code contract** (`Step::code`) — operator-visible; do not
  reorder.  Failed step name is also written to stderr.
- **Pre-flight rejects real-UID 0** before any state change.  Avoids
  confused-deputy where root scripts accidentally inherit a
  half-built namespace.
- **Unsafe quarantine** in `syscall.rs` — `lib.rs` uses
  `deny(unsafe_code)` rather than `forbid`; `syscall.rs` carries
  `allow(unsafe_code)` + `deny(clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks)`
  per security-baseline rule 1 exception policy.  Every unsafe block
  has a `SAFETY:` comment.

### Phase-2 next steps (the next session's queue)

In order:

1. **Privileged-path validation.**  Set up a rooted-test harness
   (probably a `cargo test --ignored` group gated by `is_root`).
   The lifecycle modules only have unprivileged-path unit tests
   today; the actual `unshare`+`mount`+`setuid` paths are
   exercised only by integration.

2. **Daemon-IPC channel for the activated mapping table.**  Step 6
   (`mounts.rs`) needs to receive the `EpochMapping`
   (`v2-babbleon-core::mapping`) from the daemon at exec time —
   the launcher MUST NOT hold the per-host secret.  Design:
   one-shot pipe from the daemon, sent over a Unix socket at
   `/run/babbleon/launcher.sock`; payload is the activated
   table (scrambled → wrapper path) serialised as a JSONL block.
   Once received, the launcher does the bind-mount loop.

3. **Unified runtime-table wrapper bind-mount.**  v1 bind-mounts
   one wrapper per tracked tool; v2 should bind a single unified
   wrapper (already generated by
   `v2-babbleon-core::wrapper::write_wrapper`) at every scrambled
   name and let it read the table file at exec time.  Cheaper at
   N=200+ tools.

4. **Credential-dir tmpfs overlay.**  Port v1's
   `credentials::apply_untrusted_gate` under v2 conventions.
   Lives in `crates/v2-babbleon-core/src/credentials.rs` (new).

5. **PAM module (`crates/v2-babbleon-pam/`).**  C shim invoking
   the launcher at session open.  Existing v1 PAM code at
   `crates/babbleon-pam/` is reference; rewrite under v2 names.

6. **Clean up the 12 pedantic warnings** in the launcher crate.
   `cargo clippy -p v2-babbleon-launch-untrusted --fix --lib` does
   7 of them mechanically; the `similar_names` on
   `real_uid`/`real_gid` warrants a per-item allow with inline
   justification (operator-facing names; matter for the lifecycle
   semantics).

7. **Documentation update.**  Edit `docs/v2/least-privilege.md` to
   reflect the actual ordering (step 8 runs after step 10 in the
   orchestrator).  See main.rs::run comment.

### What this DOES NOT defeat yet

Until items 1-3 land:

- The launcher mounts an empty tmpfs at `/run/babbleon/scrambled`
  and `execve`s the child.  The child sees an empty scrambled
  view (no tool wrappers bound in).  This is enough to validate
  the namespace+caps+seccomp pipeline but is NOT yet a working
  obfuscation system.
- Pre-flight rejects root, but the launcher trusts whatever the
  daemon installer set up at `/run/babbleon/` — if that
  directory is missing, step 6 returns `Error::Mount` and
  exits with code 6.  A daemon-side liveness check is filed as
  follow-up.

---

## Phase 0 docs — complete

All three phase-0 docs are filed (2026-06-18).  Next session
picks up phase 2 (launcher + PAM port) or phase 3
(preprocessor); the doc track no longer blocks.

Filed 2026-06-18:

- `docs/v2/security-baseline.md` — 15 rules covering crate root
  config, secret handling, KDF discipline, naming/doc templates,
  process hardening, capability annotation, serde trap closure,
  allowed-primitives ban list, error hygiene, secret-arg
  passing, layered tests; rule-summary table; per-crate
  certification procedure.  v2-babbleon-core verified compliant
  against rules 1, 3, 7, 11; remaining rules pass at the current
  snapshot.
- `docs/v2/threat-model.md` — 30-row STRIDE matrix re-evaluated
  for v2 (with new rows for preprocessor / mapping-worker /
  structural-scramble surfaces), ATT&CK v17 mapping,
  D3FEND mapping, NIST SP 800-190 §§4.4–4.5 subsection map,
  NIST SP 800-207 seven-tenet map, the three v1 limitations
  (L1 BYOE-runtime / L2 BYOE-payload / L3 libc-leak) re-affirmed
  as still load-bearing, detection signals, failure modes,
  update cadence.
- `docs/v2/attack-mapping.md` — forward direction (ATT&CK ID →
  status → mechanism → D3FEND ID → v2 code surface) covering
  all 12 ATT&CK tactics and ~60 techniques.  Reverse direction
  (each of 7 D3FEND techniques v2 implements → ATT&CK IDs
  covered).  Coverage-statistics table per tactic.  Strongest
  coverage in Credential Access (11 Defends) + Discovery
  (4 Defends).  Pointer table to where in the v2 docs the
  mechanism behind each row lives.

The three operator-design docs from this session:

- `docs/v2/dynamic-keywords.md` (item B above)
- `docs/v2/gui-design.md` (item C above)
- Update to `docs/v2/structure-scrambling.md` layer 4 (item A above)

---

## Git / branch hygiene

- Push target: `claude/magical-turing-mele8c`.  Operator confirmed
  the eventual rename to `v1-maintenance`; mechanical rename is
  out-of-band.
- Repo stop-hook requires `noreply@anthropic.com` committer.  Use
  `git -c user.name=Claude -c user.email=noreply@anthropic.com commit`
  on every commit.
- After each commit: `git push origin HEAD:claude/magical-turing-mele8c`.
- Never `--force-push` without `--force-with-lease`; parallel
  sessions may have landed commits in the interim.
- **Do not run `cargo test --workspace`** — it will trip on v1
  drift and waste CPU.  Run `cargo test -p v2-babbleon-core` (and
  later `-p v2-babbleon-*`) only.

---

## Note for the next session

This chat has grown very long (token cost is significant).  The
operator asked for a fresh start.  Everything you need is in:

- This `HANDOFF.md`
- `V2_PLAN.md`
- `docs/v2/*` (read in the order listed at the top of this doc)
- `TODO.md` (sections labelled `v2`)

**Three operator-design items (A/B/C above) are filed in this
HANDOFF and need to be folded into the v2 docs before phase 1
mapping is considered done.**  Highest leverage: item A (layer 4
word-tags) because it changes the layer-4 design that
`structure-scrambling.md` already documents incorrectly.

You can pick up phase 1 from the wrapper template port (item 1
in the phase-1 queue above) without folding the design items
in first if the wrapper work is more urgent — they're orthogonal.

Push only to `claude/magical-turing-mele8c`.  Treat v1 as
read-only.  Commit author must be `noreply@anthropic.com` or the
stop-hook will complain.
